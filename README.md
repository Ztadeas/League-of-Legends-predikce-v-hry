# League of Legends win probability

This application shows you live probabiity of winning in League of Legends game and killing each enemy champion.
It uses ML model called Naive Bayes to predict the probabibiity.
In application folder is a code and all dependencies needed.

I also created installer so u can download it and then run without python needed to be installed on your pc.

After installing just open the folder and run <strong>LoL_probability</strong> file.
